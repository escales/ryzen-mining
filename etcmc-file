I have three nodes on the same network that have been earning ETCPOW but don’t seem to be syncing properly. They keep saying synchronization failed, dropping peer. I just changed the port on one of them and attempted to change the port on another but the START_GETH_FAST_NODE.bat file wasn’t the same file that I edited in the first one. The file that I changed successfully looked like this:

@echo off
setlocal enabledelayedexpansion

title Ethereum Classic Node

:: Set the path to the configuration file
set CONFIG_PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\ETCMC ETC NODE LAUNCHER 1920x1080\ETCMC_GUI\ETCMC_GETH\config.toml

:: Check if the configuration file exists
if not exist "!CONFIG_PATH!" (
    echo Configuration file not found at !CONFIG_PATH!.
    echo Please make sure the file exists and try again.
    pause
    exit /b
)

:: Start the Ethereum Classic Geth node with the specified configurations
geth --classic ^
--config "!CONFIG_PATH!" ^
--cache 1024 ^
--metrics ^
--identity "ETCMCgethNode" ^
-- port “30305”
console

The START_GETH_FAST_NODE.bat file in my other node looks like this:

@echo off
title Ethereum Classic Node
geth --classic --syncmode "snap" --cache 1024 --metrics --http --http.addr "localhost" --http.port "8545" --http.corsdomain "*" --ws --ws.addr "localhost" --ws.port "8546" --ws.origins "*" --datadir ".\gethDataDirFastNode" --identity "ETCMCgethNode" console

Can I still add —port “30306” before console in this second file? Why is it different than my other node?
